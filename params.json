{"name":"Open Social Media Monitoring","body":"### Welcome to Open Social Media Monitoring\r\nMicro-blogging platforms like Twitter and Facebook are very fast-paced and it's easy to miss things that are important to your brand or things you're interested in. \r\n\r\nOpen Social Media Monitoring (OSMM) is based on PHP and MySQL and can be used to monitor keywords on Twitter and Facebook. Other channels such such as blogs, online forums or videos are currently not supported, but you're welcome to fork us and add any feature you can think of or send us a feature request.\r\n\r\n### Magento\r\nWe're currently also working on an OSMM Magento extension which will eventually be released in a separate Github repository and on Magento Connect. Watch this repo or subscribe to the RSS feed to stay tuned.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nOSMM is currently developed by @nickw108, @tim-openstream and @alfred-r from [Openstream Internet Solutions](http://www.openstream.ch).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you have problems installing OSMM, please create an issue on our Github repository and we'll try to assist you in the best way possible.","tagline":"The Open Source Twitter and Facebook Monitoring Suite","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
