Installation:
- Upload all files onto your server. You can upload them to either your root(~), or sub-directory.
- Open the script installed with your browser and follow the web-based installation.
- Create a new cron-job. You may do so by scheduling http://yourdomain.com/path_to_script/cron/ with an interval you prefer. Please use the standard 'wget' (without quotation marks) command. The script will grab new data from all available sources.


Configuration:
- Just add the project, add keywords and with the first cron script run you will see the first results. You can run cron.php manually from your browser as well. This may be necessary to capture new, updated data.
